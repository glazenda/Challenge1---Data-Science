The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on weekdays, 
Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active during the day. 
On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities. However, a toll bridge, with a two way toll,
between the two cities causes driver partners to tend to be exclusive to each city. 
The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners
to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs.

Project deals with statistical testing and predictive modeling for the above.
